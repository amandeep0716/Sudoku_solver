# 🧩 Sudoku Solver in Python

A Python-based Sudoku Solver that uses the **backtracking algorithm** to solve any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. It takes a partially filled grid and fills it with a valid solution according to Sudoku rules.

## 📌 Features

- ✔️ Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku board
- 🔄 Uses recursive backtracking
- 📦 Simple and clean Python code
- 🧪 Easy to test and modify

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required

## 🎮 How It Works

The solver scans the grid for empty cells and fills them with a valid number (1–9) by checking row, column, and box constraints. If a number leads to a dead-end, the algorithm backtracks and tries the next number.
